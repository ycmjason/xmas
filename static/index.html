            So this domain, kodarie.com, is your Christmas present! LOL! I searched for this domain randomly one day during work. As you know I was working on a project named after you,
            so that's why I was wondering if this domain was bought already.
          </p>
          <p>
            How lucky you are! It is available! So I guess I would just buy it for you.
            You could now host websites, email addresses on this domain (feel free to find me to help)! :)
          </p>
          <p>
            I have already setup me@kodarie.com for you and I can help you set it up on gmail so that you could receive/send emails with it.
